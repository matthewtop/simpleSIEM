# üõ°Ô∏è SimpleSIEM - Your personal System Log Guardian

A simple, personal (very minimalised and not complicated version) of your own Security Information and Management System (SIEM)written in Python. It analyzes Linux system logs from `journalctl` in near real-time. It detects basic suspicious actions and immediately sends you alert via Telegram.

*   **System Log Monitoring:** Continuously analyzes logs from `journalctl`
*   **Incident Detection:** Predefined rules to identify common security events
*   **Telegram Notifications:** Instant alerts for detected incidents **directly** to your phone
*   **Duplicate Avoidance:** Uses **SHA256 hashing of incident details** to avoid sending duplicate alerts for the same event.
*   **Local Logging:** Records all detected incidents to a file for later analysis
*   **Simple Configuration:** Minimal setup required to get started
*   **Lightweight & Modular:** Easy to understand and potentially extend for your own needs
